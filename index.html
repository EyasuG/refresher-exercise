    <h1>What is persistence?</h1>

    <p>Believe it or not, success really comes down to only one thing…and that one thing makes the biggest difference
        between people who succeed and people who don’t. It simply means finishing what you start and not giving up in
        the face of challenges.Persistence refers to perseverance in spite of fatigue or frustration.

        you make mistakes. Even when life feels impossible.</p>

        difficulty or opposition. Meaning throughout all of the trials and tribulations being thrown in to your path of
        success keeping a determined mind set you would be able to get through</p>

    <h2>The power of persistence</h2>

    <p>Before Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) was one of the world’s largest restaurants, Colonel Sanders drove all across
        the country from restaurant to restaurant cooking batches of chicken for restaurant owners and their employees
        looking for someone willing to purchase his chicken recipe. Colonel Sanders persisted through 1,009 rejections
        until he got a ‘yes’(Anthony Robbins, Unlimited Power, (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1986)
        After his first ‘yes,’ his franchising idea began to take off. By 1964, at age 74, Colonel Sanders had more than
        600 franchised outlets for his chicken in the United States and Canada, and he sold his interest in the U.S.
        Company for $2 million ($13 million in 2006 dollars). KFC now does billions in sales each year and serves
        millions of customers daily in over 13,000 restaurants in 80 countries.</p>
